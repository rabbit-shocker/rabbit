The following programs are needed.

* Xcode Tools (from Xcode Tools DVD or ADC)
* X11 (from Mac OS X System DVD)

== Install MacPorts

see ((<URL:http://www.macports.org/>)).

=== Configuration of MacPorts

First, get the Rabbit portfiles from the subversion repository,

  ~% svn co http://www.cozmixng.org/repos/dports/trunk dports
  ~% cd dports
  ~/dports% portindex

Then, edit /opt/local/etc/macports/sources.conf like this,

  # To enable your local ports repository, uncomment and customize the
  # following line to point at your local dports directory
  # Example: file:///Users/landonf/misc/darwinports/dports
  #
  file:///Users/yourname/dports # <- here
  # To get darwinports from the darwinports rsync server use:
  # rsync://rsync.darwinports.org/dpupdate/dports
  rsync://rsync.darwinports.org/dpupdate/dports

(/Users/yourname is your home directory)

"port info" command tells you if the installation succeeded or not.

  ### OK ###
  ~% port info rb-rabbit
  rb-rabbit 0.5.1, Revision 0, ruby/rb-rabbit
  {http://www.cozmixng.org/~rwiki/?cmd=view;name=Rabbit}
  # snip #

  ### NG ###
  ~% port info rb-rabbit
  No port rb-rabbit found.

Remember to set this variable.
