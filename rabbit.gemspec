You can create your slide as a text file. It means that you can version control
your slide like your Ruby scripts. You can custom your slide style by Ruby.
So Rabbit is for Rubyist.

You can use RD, Markdown and Wiki format as slide source.

Rabbit provides programmer friendly keyboard interface. It uses Emacs and Vi
style keybindings by default.

You can use PDF and image as slide source. Rabbit can show PDF and image
directly. You can create your slide by other presentation tool and show your
slide by Rabbit. If you show your slide by Rabbit, you can use programmer
friendly keyboard interface provided by Rabbit to control your slide.

You can upload your slide as a gem. If you publish your slide as a gem, you
can see your slide at https://slide.rabbit-shocker.org/ .
