== 3.0.0: 2019-09-06

GTK+ 3 support release. GTK+ 2 support is dropped.

Wide (16.9 ratio) slide support release. Note that this is a backward
incompatible change.

=== Improvements

==== rabbit

  * Added support for wide (16:9 ratio) slide.

    To use wide slide, you just specify wide size by
    ((%--size%)) option such as ((%--size 800,450%)).

    This is a backward incompatible change. If you already use wide
    size, text size in your slide is changed.

    You can use the same text size in normal (4:3 ratio) slide and
    wide (16:9 ratio) slide since this release. Text size is different
    before this release.

  * Changed to use GTK+ 3 by default.

  * Dropped support for GTK+ 2.

  * Added support for "as large as possible text" without wrapping.

    This is a change that may change slide rendering result.

  * Stopped to reset timer on reload.

  * Added support for (({start-time})) and (({end-time})) title slide
    attributes.

    If both (({start-time})) and (({end-time})) are specified, you
    don't need to specify (({allotted-time})). (({allotted-time})) can
    be computed from them.

    Here is an example that show how to specify 1 hour talk:

      = Title

      : start-time
         2017-10-08T11:00:00+09:00
      : end-time
         2017-10-08T12:00:00+09:00

  * Dropped support for getting slide source from Hiki.

  * Dropped support for getting slide source from SlideShare.

  * RD: Removed (({<URL:...>})) mark from the default text of URL link.

    This is a change that may change slide rendering result.

  * Added support for animation GIF.

  * Stopped to force keeping above.
    ((%--no-keep-above%)) option is also removed.

    [Suggested by Shugo Maeda]

  * info-window: Added support for reloading theme.

    character for file name.

Major version up!

Slides and themes can be shared. Both of them can be registered as gem
at RubyGems.org. If you specify a slide gem, ((%rabbit%)) command
installs and shows it automatically. If you specify a theme gem,
((%rabbit%)) command installs and uses it automatically.

A tool that publishes your slide to SlideShare with one command is
also added. You can share your slide more easily.

Some utilities such as RabbiRack and Rabbiter are splited as new
packages. You needed to install related libraries manually. Now, you
can install them automatically by installing those tools. It's easy to
install.
